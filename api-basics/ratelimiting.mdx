title: 'Rate limiting'
description: 'The BIOS API relies on rate limiting to ensure stable and reliable behavior for all clients, in both the Production and Sandbox environments.'

## Limits per time period
Rate limiting is the controlling of requests received and processed in a given time period.
Rate limits apply to all endpoints. The maximum number of calls allowed in a given period is as follows:

| Time period | Description       |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| 15 minutes  | 2,300             |
| 30 minutes  | 4,500             |
| 1 hour      | 8,800             |
| 24 hours    | 105,600           |

If you exceed the rate limits, you receive a 429 HTTP response code with the following response body:

```json Error example (JSON)
{
  "message" : "Rate limit exceeded. Please contact support for more assistance",
  "type" : "rate_limit",
  "id" : *,
  "date" : *,
  "errors" : null
}
```

If you frequently encounter issues related to rate limiting, please contact the Support team to make sure your integration is appropriate, or to increase your rate limits.

## Response header information
The response header of all API calls provides useful information regarding the rate limit:

| Header                 | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x-ratelimit`            | Indicates the number of API calls you have made.                                                                            |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining`  | Indicates the number of API calls you have left before reaching the limit.                                                  |
| `x-ratelimit-reset`      | Indicates how long you have to wait until reset (in timestamp format).<br/> There is one x-ratelimit-reset for each time period. |

The header information can prove particularly useful if you plan on making a lot of API requests in a short period of time (such as batch payouts or transfers for instance). 

The rate limit information can allow you to:
- Automatically stop sending requests once the limit has been reached and then start making requests again at the x-ratelimit-reset time
- Automatically set pauses in between calls to ensure you donâ€™t go over the limit

## API implementation best practices
An implementation can be optimized to avoid reaching the rate limits.

The following oversights commonly increase the risk of exceeding the rate limit:
- Failed requests being indefinitely retried
- Systematic GET requests without the platform storing or caching the corresponding information
- GET requests made daily while they could be made at a larger interval (weekly, monthly)
- Requests triggered on a fixed interval while they could be triggered after the corresponding POST request has been made instead
