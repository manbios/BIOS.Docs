| Type | Format       |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| `Dates` | Date and time values are displayed as a **timestamp**, which is an integer representing the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).            |
| `Parameters` | The names of the parameters displayed in requests are **case-sensitive.**            |
| `ID` | All object IDs are provided as strings (even though they may look like integers).            |
| `Amounts` | All monetary amounts are given as **integer numbers in cents** (by default, Eurocent, which is the smallest sub-division of the currency, e.g. 12.60 EUR would be represented as 1260 whereas 12 JPY would be represented as just 12).            |
| `Currencies` | Currencies follow the **ISO_4217** format.<br/><br/>As of today, the following currencies can be used: AED, AUD, CAD, CHF, CZK, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, NOK, PLN, SEK, USD, and ZAR.<br/><br/>**Note:** The available currencies vary across payment methods, cards, wallets, and payouts, and according to your contract.            |
